## Understanding Docker images
We will cover:
* What is an image.
* What is a layer.
* The various image namespaces.
* How to search and download images.

----

### What is an image?

* An image is a collection of files + some meta data.  
(Technically: those files form the root filesystem of a container.)
* Images are made of layers, conceptually stacked on top of each other.
* Each layer can add, change, and remove files.
* Images can share layers to optimize disk usage, transfer times, and memory use.

----

### Container vs. Image

* An image is a read-only filesystem.
* A container is an encapsulated set of processes running in a read-write copy of that filesystem.
* docker run starts a container from a given image.

Images are like templates that you can create containers from.

----

### ...or in object oriented terms:

* *Images* are similar to `classes`.
* *Layers* are similar to `inheritance`.
* *Containers* are similar to `instances`.

----

### Butâ€¦

If an image is read-only, how do we change it?
* We create a new container from that image.
* Then we make changes to that container.
* We can then transform them into a new layer.
* A new image is created by stacking the new layer on top of the old image.

----

### Creating the lowest layer

There is a special empty image called scratch.
* It has no files or operating system

Note: you will probably never need to use scratch.

----

### Creating New Images

`docker commit`
* Saves all the changes made to a container into a new layer.
* Creates a new image (effectively a copy of the container).

`docker build`
* Performs a repeatable build sequence.
* This is the preferred method!

----

### Image namespaces
There are three namespaces:
* Root-like
    * ubuntu
* User (and organizations)
    * mesosphere/marathon
* Self-Hosted
    * registry.example.com:5000/my-private-image

----

### Root namespaces
The root namespace is for "official images". They are put there by Docker Inc., but they are generally authored and maintained by third parties.

Those images include:
* Distro images to be used as bases for your builds, like ubuntu, fedora...
* Images for building and running software e.g. golang, php, java
* Ready-to-use components and services, like redis, postgresql...

----

### User namespaces
The user namespace holds images for Docker Hub users and organizations.
For example:
* mesosphere/marathon
The Docker Hub user is:
* mesosphere
The repository name is:
* marathon

----

### Self-hosted namespace

This namespace holds images which are not hosted on Docker Hub, but on third party registries.

They contain the hostname (or IP address), and optionally the port, of the registry server.
For example:
* localhost:5000/wordpress
The remote host and port is:
* localhost:5000
The repository name is:
* wordpress

----

### List images on your host

Run `docker images`

```bash

```

----

### Downloading images

There are two ways to download images.
* Explicitly, with `docker pull`.
* Implicitly, when executing `docker run` and the image is not found locally.

----

### Pulling an image
```bash
docker pull alpine:latest
```
As seen previously, images are made up of layers.
* Docker has downloaded all the necessary layers.

----

### Image and Tags
Images can have tags.
* Tags define image versions or variants.
* `docker pull alpine` will refer to `alpine:latest`.
* But latest confers no special meaning other than being a default
* It is not automically kept up-to-date
* It is not guaranteed to exist
* Idiomatically it will be the latest stable version

----

### When to use or not to use tags
Don't specify tags:
* When doing rapid testing and prototyping.
* When experimenting.

Do specify tags:
* When recording a procedure into a script.
* When going to production.
* To ensure that the same version will be used everywhere.
* To ensure repeatability later

----

### Do it yourself

* Search Dockerhub for e.g. mysql
* Pull the selected image

----

## Building images interactively
We will create our first container image, by:
* Creating a container from a base image.
* Installing software manually in the container, and turn it into a new image.
* Learning about new commands: `docker commit`, `docker tag`, and `docker diff`.

----

### Create and modify new container

#### Preparation/Do it yourself
* Our base image will be the Ubuntu image  
* Start the Ubuntu container and install figlet  
* Detach from the container

----

### Create and modify new container

Start Ubuntu container
```bash
docker run -ti ubuntu
```
Update apt and install figlet
```
apt-get update && apt-get install -y figlet
```
Detach from the Container
```bash
^P^Q
```

----

### Inspect the changes
Now let's run `docker diff` to see the difference between the base image and our container.

```bash
docker diff $(docker ps -lq)
C /.wh..wh.plnk
A /.wh..wh.plnk/98.3683338
C /etc
C /etc/alternatives
A /etc/alternatives/figlet
A /etc/alternatives/figlet.6.gz
C /tmp
C /usr
C /usr/bin
A /usr/bin/chkfont
A /usr/bin/figlet
A /usr/bin/figlet-figlet
A /usr/bin/figlist
A /usr/bin/showfigfonts
C /usr/share
```

----

### Docker tracks filesystem changes

* An image is read-only.
* Any changes occur in a copy of the image.
* `docker diff` shows the differences between the image and its copy.
* For performance, Docker uses copy-on-write systems.  
(i.e. starting a container based on a big image doesn't incur a huge copy.)

----

### Commit and run your image

The `docker commit` command will create a new layer with those changes, and a new image using this new layer.
```bash
docker commit $(docker ps -lq)
sha256:e5909bae970902c0d52b8825ac96e45ab644728068679d0806de57bc5c5c1512
```
The output of the docker commit command is the ID for your newly created image.

We can run this image:
```bash
docker images
docker run -ti <IMAGE-ID>
```

----

### Tagging images

Referring to an image by its ID is not intuitive. Let's tag it instead.
We can use the tag command:
```bash
docker tag <newImageId> figlet
```

But we can also specify the tag as an extra argument to commit:
```bash
docker commit <containerId> figlet
```
And then run it using its tag:
```bash
docker run -it figlet
```

----

## Building images with a Dockerfile

We will build a container image automatically, with a Dockerfile.
At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
* Write a Dockerfile.
* Build an image from a Dockerfile.

----

### Dockerfile overview

A Dockerfile is a build recipe for a Docker image.
* It contains a series of instructions telling Docker how an image is constructed.
* The docker build command builds an image from a Dockerfile.

----

### Writing our first Dockerfile

Our Dockerfile must be in a new, empty directory.
* Create a directory to hold our Dockerfile.
```bash
mkdir myimage
```
* Create a Dockerfile inside this directory.
```bash
cd myimage
vim Dockerfile
```
Of course, you can use any other editor of your choice. Or use a container with the editor of your choice :-)

----

### Type this in your Dockerfileâ€¦

```bash
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y figlet
```
* `FROM` indicates the base image for our build.
* Each `RUN` line will be executed by Docker during the build.
* Our RUN commands must be non-interactive.  
(No input can be provided to Docker during the build thatâ€™s why we will add the -y flag to apt-get.)

----

### Build the image
Save our file, then execute:
```
docker build -t figlet .
```
* `-t` indicates the tag to apply to the image.
* `.` indicates the location of the build context.  
(We will talk more about the build context later; but to keep things simple: this is the directory where our Dockerfile is located.)

----

### What happens when we build the image?

The output of docker build looks like this:
```
docker build -t figlet .
Sending build context to Docker daemon 84.48 kB
Step 1 : FROM ubuntu
 ---> 42118e3df429
Step 2 : RUN apt-get update
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 48fb734e0326
Step 3 : RUN apt-get install -y figlet
 ---> Using cache
 ---> ccd7cf351f38
Successfully built ccd7cf351f38
```
The output of the run commands has been omitted

----

### Sending the build context to Docker

```
Sending build context to Docker daemon 84.48 kB
```
* The build context is the . directory given to docker build.
* It is sent (as an archive) by the Docker client to the Docker daemon.
* This allows to use a remote machine to build using local files.
* Be careful (or patient) if that directory is big and your link is slow

----

### Executing each step
```
docker build -t figlet .
Sending build context to Docker daemon 84.48 kB
Step 1 : FROM ubuntu
 ---> 42118e3df429
Step 2 : RUN apt-get update
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 48fb734e0326
Step 3 : RUN apt-get install -y figlet
 ---> Using cache
 ---> ccd7cf351f38
Successfully built ccd7cf351f38
```
* A container (42118e3df429) is created from the base image.
* The RUN command is executed in this container.
* The container is committed into an image (48fb734e0326).
* The build container (42118e3df429) is removed.
* The output of this step will be the base image for the next one.
* â€¦

----

Try re-running the same build:

```
docker build -t figlet .
```

----

### The caching system

* After each build step, Docker takes a snapshot.
* Before executing a step, Docker checks if it has already built the same sequence.
* Docker uses the exact strings defined in your Dockerfile:
    * `RUN apt-get install figlet curl` is different from
    * `RUN apt-get install curl figlet`
    * `RUN apt-get update` is not re-executed when the mirrors are updated

You can force a rebuild with docker build --no-cache ....

----

### Run it

```bash
docker run -ti figlet
```
```
root@00f0766080ed:/# figlet hello
 _          _ _       
| |__   ___| | | ___  
| '_ \ / _ \ | |/ _ \ 
| | | |  __/ | | (_) |
|_| |_|\___|_|_|\___/ 
                      
root@00f0766080ed:/# 
```

----

### Using image and showing history

The history command lists all the layers composing an image. 
For each layer, it shows its creation time, size, and creation command. 
When an image was built with a Dockerfile, each layer corresponds to a line of the Dockerfile.

```
docker history figlet
IMAGE               CREATED             CREATED BY                                      SIZE                COMMENT

```

----

### CMD and Entrypoint
In this lesson, we will learn about two important Dockerfile commands: 
* CMD and ENTRYPOINT.

Those commands allow us to set the default command to run in a container.

----

### Defining a default command
When people run our container, we want to welcome them with a nice hello message, and using a custom font.
For that, we will execute:
```bash
figlet -f script hello
```

* `-f script` tells figlet to use a fancy font.
* hello is the message that we want it to display.

----

### Adding CMD to our Dockerfile
Our new Dockerfile will look like this:
```bash
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y figlet
CMD figlet -f script hello
```
* `CMD` defines a default command to run when none is given.
* It can appear at any point in the file.
* Each CMD will replace and override the previous one.
* As a result, while you can have multiple CMD lines, it is useless.

----

### Build and testâ€¦

Build the image
```bash
docker build -t figlet .
Sending build context to Docker daemon 91.65 kB
Step 1 : FROM ubuntu
 ---> 42118e3df429
Step 2 : RUN apt-get update
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 48fb734e0326
Step 3 : RUN apt-get install -y figlet
 ---> Using cache
 ---> ccd7cf351f38
Step 4 : CMD figlet -f script hello
 ---> Running in 8b91b84a7c86
 ---> acd649aa600f
Removing intermediate container 8b91b84a7c86
Successfully built acd649aa600f
```

----

Run it
```bash
docker run -ti figlet
 _          _   _       
| |        | | | |      
| |     _  | | | |  __  
|/ \   |/  |/  |/  /  \_
|   |_/|__/|__/|__/\__/ 
```

----

### Overriding CMD

If we want to get a shell into our container (instead of running figlet), we just have to specify a different program to run:
```bash
docker run -ti figlet /bin/bash
root@ca2a5d0b77c5:/# 
```

* We specified `bash`.
* It replaced the value of `CMD`.

----

### Using ENTRYPOINT
We want to be able to specify a different message on the command line, while retaining figlet and some default parameters.
In other words, we would like to be able to do this:
```bash
docker run -ti figlet g'day!
       _     _             _
  __ _( ) __| | __ _ _   _| |
 / _` |/ / _` |/ _` | | | | |
| (_| | | (_| | (_| | |_| |_|
 \__, |  \__,_|\__,_|\__, (_)
 |___/               |___/

```

----

Our new Dockerfile will look like this:
```bash
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install figlet
ENTRYPOINT ["figlet", "-f", "script"]
```

### Using ENTRYPOINT
* `ENTRYPOINT` defines a base command (and its parameters) for the container.
* The command line arguments are appended to those parameters.
* Like `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT` can appear anywhere, and replaces the previous value.

----

### Build and testing

docker build -t figlet .

docker run -ti figlet "g'day!"
       _     _             _
  __ _( ) __| | __ _ _   _| |
 / _` |/ / _` |/ _` | | | | |
| (_| | | (_| | (_| | |_| |_|
 \__, |  \__,_|\__,_|\__, (_)
 |___/               |___/

```

----

### What if we want to use CMD and Entrypoint together?
Then we will use `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` together.
* `ENTRYPOINT` will define the base command for our container.
* `CMD` will define the default parameter(s) for this command.

----

### The DOCKERFILE
Our new `DOCKERFILE` will look like this:
```bash
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y figlet
ENTRYPOINT ["figlet", "-f", "script"]
CMD ["hello"]
```
* `ENTRYPOINT` defines a base command (and its parameters) for the container.
* If we don't specify extra command-line arguments when starting the container, the value of CMD is appended.
* Otherwise, our extra command-line arguments are used instead of CMD.

----

### Build and test
Build it
```bash
docker build -t figlet .
```
Run it
```
docker run -ti figlet
 _          _   _       
| |        | | | |      
| |     _  | | | |  __  
|/ \   |/  |/  |/  /  \_
|   |_/|__/|__/|__/\__/ 
```
```bash
docker run -ti figlet g'day!
       _     _             _
  __ _( ) __| | __ _ _   _| |
 / _` |/ / _` |/ _` | | | | |
| (_| | | (_| | (_| | |_| |_|
 \__, |  \__,_|\__,_|\__, (_)
 |___/               |___/
```

----

### Overriding ENTRYPOINT
What if we want to run a shell in our container? 
We cannot just do `docker run -ti figlet /bin/bash` because that would just tell figlet to display the word "/bin/bash." 

We use the `--entrypoint` parameter:

```bash
docker run -ti --entrypoint /bin/bash figlet
root@c138bf9ec9ad:/# 
```

----

### Copying files during the build
So far, we have installed things in our container images by downloading packages. 
We can also copy files from the build context to the container that we are building. 

Remember: the build context is the directory containing the Dockerfile. 

In this chapter, we will learn a new Dockerfile keyword: `COPY`.

----

### Build some Golang

We want to build a container that compiles a basic "Hello world" program in Go.
Here is the program, hello.go:
```golang
package main
 
import "fmt"
 
func main() { fmt.Println("Hello world!") }
```

Let's create a new directory, and put this file in there.

Then we will write the Dockerfile.

----

### The DOCKERFILE
On Debian and Ubuntu, the package build-essential will get us a compiler.
When installing it, don't forget to specify the `-y` flag, otherwise the build will fail (since the build cannot be interactive).
Then we will use COPY to place the source file into the container.

```bash
FROM debian

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y golang

COPY hello.go /
RUN go build /hello.go
CMD /hello
```

----

### Build and testâ€¦

Build it
```bash
docker build -t debian_go .
```
Run it
```bash
docker run debian_go
Hello, world!
```

----

### Copy and the build cache
* Run the build again.
* Now, modify hello.go and run the build again.
* Docker can cache steps involving COPY.
* Those steps will not be executed again if the files haven't been changed.

----

### Details
* You can COPY whole directories recursively.
* Older Dockerfiles also have the ADD instruction.  
It is similar but can automatically extract archives.
    * If we really wanted to compile Go code in a container, we would:
        * Place it in a different directory, with the WORKDIR instruction.
        * Even better, use the golang official image.

----

### Uploading our images to the Docker Hub
We have built our first images.
We could share those images through the Docker Hub. 
The steps would be:
* create an account on the Docker Hub
* tag our image accordingly (i.e. username/imagename)
* docker push username/imagename

Anybody can now docker run username/imagename from any Docker host.

Repositories can be set to be private as well

----

### Summary

We've learned:
* What an image is
* How to build an image interactively
* How to create a Dockerfile
* How to create an image from a Dockerfile
* The usage of `CMD`and `ENTRYPOINT`
* The usage of `COPY`
